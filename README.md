# Liver-Tumor-Detection!
Now a day’s liver cancer is one of the most prevalent
diseases that may be extremely fatal if not properly diagnosed at
early stage. The exponential growth of cells in liver is termed as
liver cancer. Since liver cancer has a very complex histology and
imaging modalities, it is difficult to diagnose it at early stage. In
order to better diagnose and treat personalized patient- specific
tumors, it is often necessary to segment and visualize them. The
huge number of slices in the input image means a big challenge
for physicians. The need to develop a segmentation technique
that is automatic and efficient is a major requirement. It is
necessary to develop a technique which would enable us to
automate this approach which is reliable, afford- able, and
accurate. In this project, we aspire to create a totally automatic
method for liver tumor segmentation in CT images using a 2D
convolutional deep neural network to beat all of the primary
issues and we propose a pyramid- based UNET model and short
skip connections for fast and precise segmentation of images
which will be helpful for the early detection of tumor in a
human’s body Conclusively, deep learning and image processing
techniques are adopted to develop a liver CT scan segmentation.
